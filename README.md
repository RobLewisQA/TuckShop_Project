# Tuckshop 
## Application Overview
### Tuckshop is a web application for use by a tuckshop vendor for recording product sales. It is designed for a youth camp, where a customer list, as well as the stock list, is known. All tables accomodate the addition, updating and deletion of records - it is assumed that the tuckshop vendor will be the only user, so there is no restricted functionality.

### The tables are configured so that new orders added will remove the quantity ordered from the stock-list and deleted orders will restore the quantity ordered. Updating an order with a different product will act like the deletion of the previous order and the creation of a new order, and this will be reflected in the orders and products tables.
